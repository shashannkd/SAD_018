                <h1>GANDIKOTA</h1>
                <p>Gandikota is a small village in the Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh that is known for its
                    spectacular gorge formed by
                    river Pennar that cuts through the Erramala hills. This handsome piece of Nature’s architecture has
                    come to be known as
                    the Hidden Grand Canyon of India by travelers who visit it and get bewitched by its beauty.</p>

                <p>There are several other attractions in and near the village that allure visitors, the most special
                    being the ancient,
                    magnificent Gandikota fort that sits majestically on top of the gorge. Apart from the unmatched
                    beauty of the gorge, the
                    mystical charm of this fort makes a visit to this village all the more exciting for history lovers
                    and adventure
                    seekers.</p>

                                    slowly stepping out and coming under the tourism spotlight, various travel ventures
                                    are starting to take hold in the
                                    village. One can get down to the gorge and engage in a number of adventure
                                    activities like rock climbing, rappelling,
                                    trekking and kayaking in Gandikota.

                                    stunning assemblage of rocks, cut and layered in the most peculiar way as if they
