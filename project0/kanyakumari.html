                <h1>KANYAKUMARI</h1>
                <p>Kanyakumari or Kanniyakumari (also known as Cape Comorin) is a town in Kanyakumari District in the
                    state of Tamilnadu in
                    India. The southernmost town in mainland India, it is sometimes referred to as 'the Land's End'.

                    A popular tourist destination in India, it is famous for its unique ocean sunrise and moonrise, the
                    133 feet
                    Thiruvalluvar Statue and Vivekananda Rock Memorial off the coast, and as a pilgrimage centre. Lying
                    at the tip of
                    peninsular India, it is the confluence of the Arabian sea, the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean.
                    It has a coastal
                    line of 71.5 km stretched on the three sides

                    The town is situated 20 km south of Nagercoil, the headquarters of Kanyakumari District, and about
                    90 km south of
                    Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala.

                    On the shores of the town is a temple dedicated to Goddess Kanyakumari (the virgin Goddess), after
                    which the town is
                    named. Kanyakumari has been a city since the Sangam period and has been referred to in old Tamil
                    literature and in
                    the accounts of Marco Polo and Ptolemy.</p>
