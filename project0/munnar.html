                <h1>MUNNAR</h1>
                <p>Munnar rises as three mountain streams merge - Mudrapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala. 1,600 m above sea
                    level, this hill
                    station was once the summer resort of the erstwhile British Government in South India. One of the
                    most sought after
                    honeymoon destinations in Kerala, Munnar is replete with resorts and logding facilities that fit a
                    wide rage of budgets.
                    Sprawling tea plantations, picturesque towns, winding lanes and holiday facilities make this a
                    popular resort town.
                    Among the exotic flora found in the forests and grasslands here is the Neelakurinji. This flower
                    which bathes the hills
                    in blue once in every twelve years, will bloom next in 2030. Munnar also has the highest peak in
                    South India, Anamudi,
                    which towers over 2,695 m.</p>
